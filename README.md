This is my final project for the Fundamentals of Computing 1 class at the University of Notre Dame during the Fall of 2014. Use the makefile to compile and execute the final program to play.

I worked alone on this. 

To operate, move the blue circle using W - up, S - down, A - left, D - right, and SPACE - shoot. Press P at any time to quit. Shoot the red squares while avoiding their lasers. After three hits you are dead. The more shots you fire, the lower your score will be. At the end, if you beat the highscore, please input your three initials.
